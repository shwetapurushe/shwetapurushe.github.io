<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>1. The Weave Analyst </h3>

<h4>An open source, analytic and visualization peer to Weave (Web- based Analytic and Visualization Environment)</h4>

The goal of the Weave Analyst is
<ol>
    <li>This peer enhances the analytic support in Weave through computations in external statistical engines.</li>
    <li>To provide a framework for providing interactive visualizations in Weave to R users via a simple R package</li>
</ol>

<h4>Design and implementation include the following:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Development of a JavaScript web application using the Angular (https://angularjs.org/) framework</li>
    <li>Deployment, installation, build system and code repository maintenance for the above application</li>
    <li>Development of an API for server-side communication with external computational engines for example R, STATA, Python</li>
    <li>Development of support for multiple data sources</li>
    <li>Integration with Weave through the provided Weave JavaScript API</li>
    <li>Evaluation of data architecture and performance evaluation for computations in R</li>
    <li>Light-weight report visualizations in D3</li>
    <li>Development and preliminary implementation of metadata standards for data and computations</li>
    <li>Preliminary implementation of analytic pipeline construction, its execution and provenance management</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Application for CDC/ASTHO/SKC/RI</h3>

<h4>An Open source visual analytic platform for epidemiological data analysis.</h4>

<p>The development of the Weave Analyst was guided through the ‘Agile’ process of development by the Department of Public Health, Seattle King County (SKC),
     Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta) and the Rhode Island Data Hub.</p>

Design and Implementation overlap with the Weave Analyst with the following additional goals

<ul>
    <li>Categorical and time data filters</li>
    <li>D3 geographical filters</li>
    <li>Additional support for epidemiological routines, for example prevention of record identification, remapping data etc.</li>
</ul>

This project included design and implementation of the following
<ul>
    <li>Exploration of different data architecture pipelines for robust data analysis</li>
    <li>Investigation of packages for parallelism in R and preliminary implementation</li>
    <li>Implementation of a storage and retrieval system for computational results</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2014 </h3>
<h4>Development of an analytic framework for multivariate ’omics’ datasets in the Analyst’s Workstation using BioConductor</h4>

This project included design and implementation of the following
