Hi, I'm Shweta and I love anything that has to do with Data Visualization in Biology.
<p>Currently I am a Senior Research Assistant at the Institute of Visualization and Perception Research (IVPR) at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.</p>
 <p>   Im working on enhancing the power of data visualization using analyses executed in external computational engines. (R and STATA)</p>

<p>My thesis project is the Weave Analyst, which is a peer software to Weave (WEb-based Analysis and Visualization Environment)
    and enhances the analytic power of visualizations in Weave</p>
